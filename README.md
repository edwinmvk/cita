## Introduction

This is a web application designed for practicing interviews, built using Next.js and TypeScript. The client-side interface is styled with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI. Authentication is managed through Kinde Auth. Each user has a personalized dashboard where they can upload their resume and job description for the interview. The interview process is conducted by a human avatar created using Three.js, featuring lip-sync capabilities, Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Speech-to-Text (STT) functionalities. The application integrates the Gemini API for chatbot interactions and utilizes Hugging Face models for personality evaluation and sentence similarity assessment. Prisma is used as the ORM, interfacing with a PostgreSQL database. This repository contains the source code for the entire application.
